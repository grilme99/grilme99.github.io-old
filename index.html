                        This website has been entirely custom-designed and programmed by 
                        me! It was designed in Figma and developed with Vue and TypeScript.

                        RoCheck is a JavaScript module that allows you to get the real IP address 
                        of any running Roblox game server. This enables you to cross-compare the 
                        IP address of any API requests made to your server to the actual Roblox 
                        IP so you can be sure that the request is authentic.

                <p>
                    My name is Brooke, and I am a programmer and web developer on Roblox! 
                    I've been programming for five years and have worked on many projects 
                    in my time on this platform. 
                </p>

                    Please, check out some of the projects I've worked on to the sides!

                    <p>
                        Throughout my development career, I've had the fantastic opportunity of 
                        developing at some of the most significant communities on Roblox. All of 
                        these communities together accumulate to over 1.46 million members and over 
                        55.6 million total visits.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        My time in these groups has given me an unspeakable opportunity to develop 
                        and refine my skills as a programmer on Roblox. Alongside this, they have 
                        given me a priceless perspective on my skill as a developer, my limits and 
                        how much further I need to go.

                    <p>
                        I spent a couple of days working on a Roblox SDK for the prevalent games platform, 
                        PlayFab. This SDK covers all PlayFab APIs (excluding a tiny amount that cannot get 
                        used on Roblox) and has out-of-the-box support for Lua and TypeScript!
